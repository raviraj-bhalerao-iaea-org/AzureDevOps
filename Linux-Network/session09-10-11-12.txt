CIDR = # of bits to use for network portion of id address range

Host bits are used for internal devices.
CIDR of /8 means 2 raise to (32-8) ip addresses can be used for machines with subnet mask of 11111111.00000000.00000000.0000000 = 255.0.0.0
CIDR of /12 means 2 raise to (32-12) ip addresses can be used for machines with subnet mask of 11111111.11110000.00000000.0000000 = 255.240.0.0
CIDR of /26 means 2 raise to (32-26) ip addresses can be used for machines with subnet mask of 11111111.11111111.11111111.1100000 = 255.255.255.192
CIDR of /19 means 2 raise to (32-19) ip addresses can be used for machines with subnet mask of 11111111.11111111.11100000.0000000 = 255.255.224.0
CIDR of /18 means 2 raise to (32-18) ip addresses can be used for machines with subnet mask of 11111111.11111111.11000000.0000000 = 255.255.192.0

Session 11

Total computers - 2000 , class A
CIDR of /21 for class - Total machines accomodated = 2048
    Privat ip range only in range of 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    21 bits reserved for network portion
        11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000 = 255.255.248.0 is subnet mask
        so range of ip addresses can be anything starging 10.0-255.0-248.0 e.g. 10.255.248.0 - 10.255.255.255 or 10.0.5.0 - 10.0.12.255


Total computers - 50 , class A
CIDR of /26 for class - Total machines accomodated = 64
    Privat ip range only in range of 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    21 bits reserved for network portion
        11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 = 255.255.255.192 is subnet mask
        so range of ip addresses can be anything starging 10.0-255.0-255.0-192 e.g. 10.255.255.192 - 10.255.255.255 or 10.0.5.0 - 10.0.5.63

Total computers - 500 , class C, 4 parts
Class C : Private Ip range in range of 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
CIDR of /23 total 
        11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000 = 192.168.254.0 - 192.168.254.127 | 192.168.254.128 - 192.168.254.255| 192.168.255.0 - 192.168.255.127| 192.168.255.128 - 192.168.255.255
so cidr of /25 for each part

        192.168.254.0/24
        192.168.254.128/25
        192.168.255.0/25
        192.168.255.128/25

Class C : Private Ip range in range of 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
CIDR of /23 total 
so cidr of /24, /25, /25 for 3 parts
    Part 1 : /24
        11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 = 192.168.255.0 - 192.168.255.255
    Part 2 : /25
        11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 = 192.168.254.0 - 192.168.254.127
    Part 2 : /25
        11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 = 192.168.254.128 - 192.168.254.255



Session 12


CIDR dirctly and precisely translates to subnet mask. e.g. /26 = 255.255.255.192, /24 255.255.255.0 etc. CIDR to subnet mask tables are readily available.

Each subnet must have a network address and its used for routing.
    First ip address in the range of subnet ip addresses is reserved as network address. This ip address with cidr is used outside of subnet for routing. e.g. 10.2.3.0/24 represents all ips from 10.2.3.0-10.2.3.255 and hence traffic to any ip in this range will be routed to this subnet.

First 4 and last ip in any subnet is reserved in azure and aws.
    1. Network address
        Each subnet must have a network address and its used for routing.
            First ip address in the range of subnet ip addresses is reserved as network address. This ip address with cidr is used outside of subnet for routing. e.g. 10.2.3.0/24 represents all ips from 10.2.3.0-10.2.3.255 and hence traffic to any ip in this range will be routed to this subnet.    
    2. Default gateway
        Any machine in the subnet will send outbound packets to this ip. Azure's internal stack handles this routing.
    3. Reserved for future use.
    4. Reserved for future use.
    Last. Used for broadcast
        Azure blocks all broadcasts, for security and performance purpose. Azure uses multicast/unicast and other cloud native mechanisms.


When Subnet mask is 'and'ed with ip address, it results the network address (first ip of the subnet) and with CIDR last ip can be calculated.
